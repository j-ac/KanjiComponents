# This document aims to be a complete list of all valuable phonetic kanji components sourced
# from Habein & Mathias' "The Complete Guide to Everyday Kanji." The book is a trove of information, 
# this seeks to distill it down to only the information useful to a student of Japanese.
# this list is very much a WORK IN PROGRESS and does not nearly cover everything, but I hope to complete the phonetic component at minimum.
