Kanji is the hardest part of learning Japanese.

They are made complicated by two facts.

They are meant to meet the needs of an entirely different language with very different grammar.

</p>
<b> 2. Japanese has been using them for over 1500 years. </b> <br>
They assume a cultural context that no longer exists, and is foreign even to modern Chinese speakers.
</p>

<p> And yet, the original logic behind many characters is still in there.
When we know what to look for, a lot of kanji frustration can be simplified away.
It just takes thinking about kanji the way they were intended to be: structured, meaningful, and built from component parts.</p>
<p> Yet no modern kanji approach I know of does this.
The two leading approaches, James Heisig's Remembering the Kanji, and WaniKani both rely heavily on invented mnemonics, even for kanji that preserve their original components cleanly.
In these cases, the funny stories are unnecessary and actually hide the logic behind the character.</p>
